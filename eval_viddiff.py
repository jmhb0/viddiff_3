- A description that explains how the two performances differ visually.

You are provided with two dictionaries:
- Dictionary 0: {differences0}
- Dictionary 1: {differences1}

Your task is to match the differences from Dictionary 0 to Dictionary 1. Here's how:
1. For each entry in Dictionary 0, find the best match in Dictionary 1.
2. Each item in Dictionary 1 can only be used once.
3. Only match entries if their description strings are visually similar, even if the word choices differ. If no suitable match exists, return "None."

Your output should be a JSON object where:
- The keys are from Dictionary 0: {dict0_keys}.
- The values are a key from Dictionary 1 or "None" if no match is found. 
- The available keys from Dictionary 1 are: {dict1_keys}.

Example output format:
{
    "0": "3",
    "1": "None",
    "2": "1",
    "3": "5",
    ...
    "{final}" : "0"
}
Important: the keys in this dictionary should be" {dict0_keys}

# You will be given pairs of statements to compare.
# Your task is to determine whether each pair of statements is equivalent or opposite in meaning.

# Instructions:

# 1. For each pair of statements, analyze their logical relationship.
# 2. Categorize each pair as follows:
#    - Return '0' if the statements are equivalent or very similar in meaning. E.g. "X is bigger than Y" and "X is larger than Y" are similar.
# - Return '1' if the statements are directly opposite in meaning. E.g. "X is bigger than Y" is opposite to "X is smaller than Y".

# Important Notes:
# - For '1' responses, the statements should be true opposites, not just differences in degree.
#   Example: "X is much bigger than Y" and "X is slightly bigger than Y" should be categorized as '0', not '1'.

# Output Format:
# Provide your response as a JSON object containing an array of "0" or "1" values:
# {"results" : ["1", "0", "0", ...]}

# Input:
# The list of statement pairs to analyze will be provided in the following format:

Task:  
You will be given pairs of statements. Your task is to determine the logical relationship between each pair.

Instructions:
1. Analyze Each Pair: For each pair of statements, carefully analyze their meaning and relationship.
2. Categorization:
   - Return "0" if the statements are equivalent, very similar, or differ only in minor details.  
     Example: "X is bigger than Y" and "X is larger than Y" should both return "0".
   - Return "1" if the statements are direct opposites in meaning.  
     Example: "X is bigger than Y" and "X is smaller than Y" should return "1".
3. Edge Cases:
   - Avoid returning "1" for statements that are not true opposites, even if they have some differences in detail or degree.
     Example: "X is much bigger than Y" and "X is slightly bigger than Y" should still return "0".

Output Format:
- Your response should be a JSON object with a single key "results" and an array of string values "0" or "1" as its value.
- The array should exactly match the number of statement pairs given in the input.

Input Format:
- The list of statement pairs will be provided in the following format:

{statements}

Important Requirements:
- Ensure that each value in the output array is either "0" or "1".
- The length of the "results" array must exactly match the number of input pairs.
