I have two videos of an action with the following description: "{action}".

Propose a set of 'differences' in how this action may be performed between the two videos. 
For each difference, give a 'name', 'description', 'query_string', and 'num_frames'.

The 'name' is a very short name that can be used as a key.

The 'description' is a slightly longer description of the difference. 
The 'query_string' is the same as 'description'.
The  descriptions should be visual and about how the action is performed. For example 'the jump is higher', or 'the arm is more straight'.
The difference descriptions should not refer to a specific video. For example you would not say 'the jump in video B is higher'. 
Instead, the 'description' would be 'the jump is higher', and the statemet could be more true of one video or the other. 

Now suppose you had to judge whether the difference was stronger in one video, but you could only look at individual frames. 
	- What's the smallest number of frames you need, assuming the frame is well-chosen? Put the answer in 'num_frames'. The answer should be '1' or 'gt_1' (meaning 'greater than 1').
	- Once you have the frames to compare, create a 'query_string' that is a simple statement about this difference that is more true in one video vs the other video (based on the frames only). For example "the left leg is higher" or "movement is faster".

List {n_differences} differences.
Return a json like this, where the differences keys are stringified ints starting from 0.
